# MISB training 2024

## Installing dependencies

The easiest way is to create a conda
environment using [`environment.yaml`](/environment.yml):

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate misb
```

## Running the notebooks

Once the dependencies are installed, open the notebooks (`.ipynb` files)
with Jupyter Lab after running the following on the command line:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

It should work on any operating system!
